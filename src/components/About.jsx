                        Hello, I'm Jaideep Murthy, a driven senior pursuing a degree in Computer Science and Engineering at NIT, Allahabad. With a keen interest in artificial intelligence and blockchain technology, I'm passionate about exploring the intersections of technology, entrepreneurship, and sustainable development.
                        <br></br>
                        <br></br>
                        My journey began with a strong foundation in computer science, leading me to various enriching experiences. I honed my technical skills and gained practical knowledge during my summer internship at Telepresenz, where I contributed to real-world projects in JavaScript web application development. Additionally, my role as a Cisco tQb Student Body Member has further fueled my passion for fostering innovation and entrepreneurship among students and startups.
                        <br></br>
                        <br></br>
                        As a student-athlete, playing college-level basketball has taught me invaluable lessons in teamwork, leadership, and discipline. These experiences have shaped my ability to balance rigorous academic pursuits with athletic commitments, enhancing my overall personal and professional development.
                        <br></br>
                        <br></br>
                        Looking forward, I aim to leverage my skills and interests to build a career in the tech industry, focusing on emerging technologies like AI and blockchain. I'm eager to connect with like-minded professionals and explore opportunities that align with my goal of contributing to a sustainable and innovative future.
